    "description":"Attenuation of electromagnetic wave due to scattering and absorption by particles in atmospheric aerosol and accumulated hydrometeors. Aerosol being considered as “a mixture of particles (= extremely small pieces of matter) and the liquid or gas that they are contained in, that can spread through the air” [Aerosol. (n.d.). In: Cambridge Dictionary. Retrieved June 21, 2021, from https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/aerosol]. Seperate consideration of attenuation by molecules in air, if relevant. Hydrometeors being considered as “particulate solid and liquid formed principally by water” [Liberti G.L. (2014) Optical/Infrared, Scattering by Aerosols and Hydrometeors. In: Njoku E.G.
