Emerging of false positive detections falsely related to beam centerline due to partwise illumination of non targeted object parts; additionally to true positive detection of targeted object part, if detection threshold is exceeded for both measured impulses. No differentiation between fraction of main beam and fraction of light from across main beam cross section illuminating non targeted object parts; here. If foreground object is close to background object; the received light power impulses may be lumped and create one combined false positive detection, if detection threshold is exceeded for both measured impulses.]"
