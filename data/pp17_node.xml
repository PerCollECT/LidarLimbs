            description="Aliasing in this context meaning the appearance of an alias object candidate, being an illusion induced by one or multiple objects moving frecquentially and relative to the sensor. If the sampling frequency, being the number of full spatial images per second, does not satisfy the Nyquist-Shannon theorem with respect to the moving frequency of the object/s, an alias object candidate occurs."
