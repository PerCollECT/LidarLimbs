            description="Security attack by continuously illuminating the victims receiver with a strong laser of the same wavelength as the victims emitter wavelength. Saturating the victims receiving photosensor and, thus, preventing it from reflecting the variations in the input signal will lead to a blind sector in its field of view. The overwhelming of an input on purpose to hinder the readout of normal input traffic is being referred as denial-of-service attack."
