            adBlock="Signal propagation" 
            description="Refractive index being the ratio of vacuum wavelength to wavelength in permeated matter, here atmosphere. Thus, being the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed of light in permeated matter, here atmosphere, and calculable by the square root of material/atmospheric dielectric permittivity multiplied by material/atmospheric magnetic permeability."
